<h2 id="computers-and-computing">Computers and Computing</h2>
<p>Computers are everywhere, but it’s not just desktops and laptops anymore. Now we have tablets, cell phones, watches, and so much more that perform the same functions. Consider what makes a computer a computer, thinking about the common bonds that unify all those things which we call “computers,” and also perhaps start to think outside the box a bit, considering whether some devices are indeed computers, but not in the traditional sense.</p>

<h2 id="how-computers-work">How Computers Work</h2>
<p>We use computers on a regular basis for nearly everything. Whether its laptops, smartphones, or tablets, all computers work in fundamentally the same way. In this section, we’ll lay out the physical components that make a computer work. We’ll talk about how various hardware components like hard drives, CPUs, RAM, ports, and more interact with software to create the experience we are familiar with today.</p>

<p>The resources in this section come from a course called Computer Science E-1a, Understanding Technology, offered at Harvard’s Extension School.</p>

<h2 id="binary-and-ascii">Binary and ASCII</h2>
<p>In this section, we want to better your understanding of binary numbers, which are fundamental in understanding the way computers represent information.</p>

<p>You are likely much more familiar with the decimal (base 10) number system; fortunately the binary (base 2) number system works in fundamentally the same way as decimal. After this section, you’ll also be prepared to encounter other number systems, such as hexadecimal, to be discussed later in the course.</p>

<p>One of the most common types of information that computers process is text. To translate numbers into text, computers use a character encoding standard called ASCII. Adopting ASCII as a universal standard enables computers to properly communicate and display more than just numeric symbols, enabling you to send texts, read online articles, use word processors, and more.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Now we can do more, by using ASCII, a standard that maps numbers to letters. For example, A is mapped to 65, B is 66, etc. Though bits can only store numbers, programs can translate those bits to letters for humans to easily read.
Here is an <a href="http://www.asciitable.com/">ASCII table</a> for the printable characters; note that the ASCII standard also encompasses some characters that are important for computers, but are not visually renderable.</li>

      <li>Think about the ASCII table, in particular some of the patterns in it. How might some of those patterns be helpful?</li>
      <li>Why do we need ASCII at all? What problems might we face if we didn’t have it?</li>
      <li>ASCII was written as a 7-bit encoding scheme, but bytes are 8 bits. Why do you think that is? What do you think that might mean about other historical standards?
        <ul>
          <li>Note: A byte was not actually standardized as 8 bits until the 1990s! ASCII was written in 1963.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>In most of our messages, are we using all of the characters in the ASCII table? What does this mean in terms of <em>optimization</em>?</li>

<h2 id="logic-and-processors">Logic and Processors</h2>
<p>We know that computers can only understand 1s and 0s. But how do they process and manipulate these 1s and 0s to add numbers, send messages, or even play chess? It all builds upon a small device called a transistor. By using transistors to represent 1s and 0s and applying rules known as Boolean logic, computers can perform complex calculations. These transistors are packaged into a chip known as the Central Processing Unit.</p>

<p>In this section, we’ll talk about transistors, Boolean logic, and how they come together to form the brains of a computer: the CPU.</p>

<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
<p>We know how computers process information, but how does this information get stored?</p>

<p>Computers can only understand 1s and 0s, so information is also stored in 1s and 0s. We measure amounts of memory by the number of binary digits, or bits, eventually building up to bytes, megabytes, gigabytes, and terabytes.</p>

<p>While all memory is stored as some number of bits, these bits are not all stored in the same way. Turns out, there are many different kinds of memory that are used for different purposes. In this section, we’ll talk about random access memory (RAM), hard disk drives (HDD), flash memory, and more. We’ll go over why there are so many kinds of memory in the first place and the trade-offs that must be made when assembling a machine, optimizing for performance, speed, and cost.</p>

<h2 id="algorithms">Algorithms</h2>
<p>An algorithm is a complete, step-by-step set of instructions for completing a task, and computers must follow those instructions exactly as written. So, computers are perhaps not as intelligent as we tend to think they are!</p>

<p>In this section, you will not yet be implementing any specific type of algorithm (such as a sorting or searching algorithm, which we will talk about later in the course), but you will be able to express algorithms using spoken or written language, and learn of the importance of defining algorithms precisely in order to have the desired effect(s) occur!</p>
