# Unit 1

## Pseudocode
Pseudocode is an analytical and programming tool that we have at our disposal which we use to present algorithms as succinctly as possible, without getting lost in notions of syntax but rather by expressing them in our native, common language. Pseudocode can be an excellent launching point for writing in any number of languages, and that we can express certain concepts inherent in languages (such as variables, loops, conditions, and statements, among others) by doing so with pseudocode. Used correctly, thinking in pseudocode may also help find bugs in your program before you even begin writing a single line of code!

__Important Note__: AP Computer Science Principles is a deliberately language-agnostic course (Code on the exam will not be written in any specific language) . This means that the ability to express oneself in pseudocode and understand sample pseudocode is a critical skill. Be sure to take a look at the reference sheet given with the college board AP exam to familiarize yourself with their formatting.

## Scratch
Scratch is a programming language designed to help introduce computer science principles while minimizing the amount of syntax you need to learn to use the language. Scratch works by letting you drag-and-drop blocks together to create a program, which is this case is just a sequence of blocks that produce some effect. There are a lot of different blocks that you can experiment with in Scratch, and Scratch is smart enough to only allow you to put blocks together when it makes sense to do so.

## Syntax
In this section, we discuss some of the finer points of programming in C, the syntax things to be on the watch for, and reassure everyone that the syntax of programming will become second nature. Almost all of the resources you could ever ask for regarding tips on syntax can be found online.

## Variables
In this section, we'll dive into variables in C. A variable is a storage container for data that is capable of holding different values that may change or update as programs execute. Your program can read the contents of a variable, update the contents of a variable, and display the value of a variable on the screen. Computer programs can use variables in order to remember useful information that the programs can then use later in the code.

## Data Types
In this section, you will learn about the primitive data types built-in to C, the special data types afforded them by the CS50 Library, the qualifiers that can be applied to data types, and the difference between static and dynamic typing.

- ### Thought Questions
  - Why is C so inflexible with data types? (Hint: Consider its history relative to modern language)
  - Imagine we don't have data types. What's `10 + "10"`? Is it `"1010"` or `"20"` (strings) or `1010` or `20` (ints)?
  - In what situations would it be preferable to use a double versus a float, or a long long versus an int? (Or vice versa)

## Operators
In addition to having operators that perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, C also has operators that perform other functions: like finding the remainder when dividing, or updating the value of a variable. C's arithmetic operators perform mathematical functions on numbers. The `+` operator adds two numbers, the `-` operator subtracts one number from another, the `*` operator multiplies two numbers, and the `/` symbol divides one number by another. C also provides assignment operators, which provide a variety of ways to update the value of a variable.

## Boolean Expressions and Conditionals
Conditional branching using Boolean expressions are how we as programmers make decisions in our programs. They allow us to not be limited to following an identical pathway through our code each time, but rather empower us to take different forks in the road, allowing for different behaviors or different user experiences. In this section we discuss conditionals, their utility, and the three main types of conditionals offered by C -- if-else, switch, and ?: (the ternary operator) as well as the Boolean expressions (`<`,`>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`, `&&`, `||`, and `!`).

## Loops
Loops are how we as programmers do the same thing over and over. Instead of copying and pasting the same line(s) of code back-to-back, which can get clunky if done a few times and downright ugly if done more than once or twice, all modern programming languages contain some variations on the construction of a loop, which permits iteration and repetition. Loops allow us to do things like counting or even implement the fundamental basic flow of a game. Perhaps in Scratch, you used the Repeat __ Times block, or the FOREVER block. In C, we have three main types of loops: for, while, and do-while. Let's dive in!
